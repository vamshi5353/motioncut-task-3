    <img src="dance (2).jpg"> <p >Dance connects us to society and culture in many universal and personal ways. It deepens our understanding of the world and ourselves. Synthesising personal knowledge and experiences with dance movements reinforces us to perceive the feelings and ideas evoked in a dance form. Dance makes us feel happy. When we dance, all our worries and stress go away. We get lost in pleasure and joy. Dance is also an exercise that provides numerous benefits to our health, such as improving blood circulation, developing muscles, promoting greater flexibility, improving body posture etc. People who dance daily are always fit and cheerful. That’s why dancers are very less likely to fall sick.</p></div>

    <img src="crossfit.jpg"><p>Some people really dread going to the gym, who really wants to get super sweaty? That feeling after the workout and the “fit-bod” are two examples of why the fitness community has developed into a multi-billion dollar industry. Crossfit is always perceived as crazy fit people that workout way to hard. To outsiders, crossfit is thought to cause more injuries than any other form of exercise.</p>
